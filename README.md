# fractol - Programming the psychedelic universe of fractals.

In this project, we were tasked with drawing a 2D graphical representation of several fractals, such as the Mandelbrot set.

![Mandelbrot-set](https://github.com/salahadawi/fractol/blob/master/images/Mandelbrot-GUI.png)
# Features

* Smooth zoom that follows the mouse position

* Image movement

* Changing maximum iterations

* Several colour schemes

* Changing exponent in the Multibrot set

* Changing Julia set input with mouse movement

Relevant information, such as zoom level and instructions, can be toggled on-screen with the '5' key.

# How to use
```
Usage: ./fractol [name of fractal]

Available fractals are:

mandelbrot
burning_ship
julia
tricorn
multibrot
```
