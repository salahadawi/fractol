# fractol - Programming the psychedelic universe of fractals.

In this project, we were tasked with drawing a 2D grapchical representation of several fractals, such as the Mandelbrot set.

# Features

* Full 3D rotation

* Camera movement

* Altitude controls

* Colors according to altitude

* Zoom in/out

* Idle animation

* Parallel/Isometric projection

Relevant information, such as rotation degrees and instructions, can be toggled on-screen with the 'H' key.

# Input

The given input map is a 2D grid of numbers, where each number corresponds to its altitude.

For example, giving the following text as input:
```
0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
0  0 10 10  0  0 10 10  0  0  0 10 10 10 10 10  0  0  0
0  0 10 10  0  0 10 10  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 10 10  0  0

0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
```
